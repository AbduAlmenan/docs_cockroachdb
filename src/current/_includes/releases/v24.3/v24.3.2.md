- The `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting has been added, which reverts the changes of #133037 that cause the change in typing behavior described in #137837. Specifically, it makes type-checking and overload resolution ignore the newly added "unpreferred" overloads. This setting defaults to `on`. [#137943][#137943]

- Regional by row tables with uniqueness constraints where the region is not part of those uniqueness constraints and which also contain non-unique indices will now have that uniqueness properly enforced when modified at READ-COMMITTED isolation. This bug was introduced in release 24.3.0. [#137367][#137367]
