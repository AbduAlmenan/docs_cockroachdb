<h3 id="v24-3-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting. When set to `on`, type-checking and overload resolution ignore the newly added `unpreferred` overload preference which causes a change in `VARCHAR` typing behavior (see [#133037][#133037]). The default value for `legacy_varchar_typing` is `on`. [#137943][#137943]

<h3 id="v24-3-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in v24.3.0 that impacts regional by row tables with uniqueness constraints when using `READ COMMITTED` isolation. Due to this bug, some non-unique indexes had a uniqueness constraint erroneously applied. This problem was fixed in this release. [#137367][#137367]
