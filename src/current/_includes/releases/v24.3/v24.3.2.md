<h3 id="v24-3-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting. This setting reverts the changes of #133037. When set to `on` (the default), type-checking and overload resolution ignore the newly added "unpreferred" overloads. [#137943][#137943]

<h3 id="v24-3-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug impacting regional by row tables with uniqueness constraints when using `READ COMMITTED` isolation. Due to this bug, some non-unique indexes would have a uniqueness constraint erroneously applied.  Uniqueness is now properly enforced only on indexes with a uniqueness constraint. This bug was introduced in v24.3.0. [#137367][#137367]
