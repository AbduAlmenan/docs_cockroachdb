Before deploying CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} in production, it is important to understand the Shared Responsibility Model that delineates the responsibilities of Cockroach Labs and the customer in managing CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters. 

Under the Shared Responsibility Model, Cockroach Labs is responsible for the following tasks: 

- Cluster and cloud service availability and reliability
- Maintenance and security of hardware and operating systems
- Database and security patches 
- Cluster backups 

The customer is responsible for the following tasks:

- Estimating workload and sizing the cluster 
- Scaling clusters based on workload
- Ensuring sufficient disk, compute, and memory capacity for each cluster
- Monitoring cluster health and application performance
- Ensuring that the workload is distributed appropriately across the nodes of the cluster
- Performance tuning of SQL queries and schema
- Initiating major version upgrades and selecting maintenance windows for patch releases 
- Taking customer-owned backups (optional)

This page provides important recommendations for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} production tasks for which  the customer is responsible.

## Deployment options

When planning your deployment, it is important to carefully review and choose the [deployment options](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/choose-a-deployment-option) that best meet your scale, cost, security, and resiliency requirements. 

Make sure your cluster has sufficient storage, CPU, and memory to handle the workload. The general formula to calculate the storage requirement is as follows:
 
`raw data (storage, in GB) * replication factor (3 by default) * remove 40% to account for compression (0.6) * headroom (1.5-2)`

For an example, see [Plan your Dedicated cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster.md %}).

## Topology patterns

When planning your deployment, it is important to carefully review and choose the [topology patterns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/topology-patterns) that best meet your latency and resiliency requirements. This is especially crucial for multi-region deployments.

## Cluster management

You can create and manage CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters using the [Cloud Console](http://cockroachlabs.cloud), [Cloud API]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-api.md %}), [ccloud CLI]({% link cockroachcloud/ccloud-get-started.md %}), or the [Terraform provider]({% link cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform.md %}).

## Network authorization

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} requires you to authorize the networks that can access the cluster in order to prevent denial-of-service and brute force password attacks. During the application development phase, you might have authorized only your local machineâ€™s network. To move into production, you need to authorize your application servers' networks.

To verify that you have authorized the application server's network, navigate to the [Networking page]({% link cockroachcloud/connect-to-your-cluster.md %}#authorize-your-network) on the  CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console and check if the application server network is listed under authorized networks. If the application server network is not on the list, authorize the network. 

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
While developing and testing your application on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}, you may have added `0.0.0.0/0` to the allowlist, which allows all networks. CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} allowlists `0.0.0.0/0` by default. Before moving into production, make sure you delete the `0.0.0.0/0` network.
{{site.data.alerts.end}} 

For enhanced network security and reduced network latency, you can set up private connectivity so that inbound connections to your cluster from your cloud tenant are made over the cloud provider's private network rather than over the public internet. For CockroachDB Dedicated clusters deployed on GCP, refer to [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %}#vpc-peering). For CockroachDB Dedicated clusters or multi-region CockroachDB Serverless clusters deployed on AWS, refer to [Amazon Web Service (AWS) PrivateLink]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %}#aws-privatelink).

## Transaction retries

When several transactions try to modify the same underlying data concurrently, they may experience [contention](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/performance-best-practices-overview#transaction-contention) that leads to [transaction retries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/transactions#transaction-retries). To avoid failures in production, your application should be engineered to handle transaction retries using [client-side retry handling](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference#client-side-retry-handling).

## SQL Best Practices

To ensure optimal SQL performance for your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} cluster, follow the best practices described in the [SQL Performance Best Practices](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/performance-best-practices-overview) guide.

## Use a pool of persistent connections

Creating the appropriate size pool of connections is critical to gaining maximum performance in an application. Too few connections in the pool will result in high latency as each operation waits for a connection to open up. But adding too many connections to the pool can also result in high latency as each connection thread is being run in parallel by the system. The time it takes for many threads to complete in parallel is typically higher than the time it takes a smaller number of threads to run sequentially.

For guidance on sizing, validating, and using connection pools with CockroachDB, see [Use Connection Pools](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/connection-pooling).

## Keeping connections current

After an application establishes a connection to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }}, those connections can occasionally become invalid. This could be due to changes in the cluster topography, rolling [upgrades]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}) and restarts, network disruptions, or cloud infrastructure unavailability.

Make sure connection validation and retry logic is used by your application. Validating and retrying connections is typically handled by the driver, framework, or the connection pool used by an application. For guidance on connection pool sizing, connection validation, and connection retry logic, see [Use Connection Pools](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/connection-pooling).

## PCI ready features (Dedicated advanced)

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} advanced has access to all features required for [PCI readiness]({% link cockroachcloud/pci-dss.md %}). You must configure these settings to make your cluster PCI-ready:

- [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Organization Audit logs]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.md %})
- [Cluster SQL audit log export]({% link cockroachcloud/export-logs.md %})
- [Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-cmek.md %})
- [Egress Perimeter Controls]({% link cockroachcloud/egress-perimeter-controls.md %})
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for your [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization]({% link cockroachcloud/configure-cloud-org-sso.md %}) and your [clusters]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-sso-sql.md %})
- [Network security]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %})

You can check the status of these features on the [**PCI ready**](cluster-overview-page.html?filters=dedicated#pci-ready-dedicated-advanced) page of the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console.

## Monitoring and alerting

Despite CockroachDB's various [built-in safeguards](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/frequently-asked-questions#how-does-cockroachdb-survive-failures) against failure, it is critical to actively monitor the overall health and performance of a cluster running in production and to create alerting rules that promptly send notifications when there are events that require investigation or intervention.

To use the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console to monitor and set alerts on important events and metrics, see [Monitoring and Alerting]({% link cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page.md %}). You can also set up monitoring with [Datadog]({% link cockroachcloud/tools-page.md %}#monitor-cockroachdb-dedicated-with-datadog) or [CloudWatch]({% link cockroachcloud/export-metrics.md %}).

## Backup and restore

For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters, Cockroach Labs runs [full cluster backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/take-full-and-incremental-backups#full-backups) hourly. The full backups are retained for 30 days. Once a cluster is deleted, Cockroach Labs retains the full backups for 30 days.

For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters, Cockroach Labs runs [full cluster backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/take-full-and-incremental-backups#full-backups) daily and [incremental cluster backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/take-full-and-incremental-backups#incremental-backups) hourly. The full backups are retained for 30 days, while incremental backups are retained for 7 days. Once a cluster is deleted, Cockroach Labs retains the full backups for 30 days and incremental backups for 7 days. Backups are stored in the same region that a single-region cluster is running in or the primary region of a multi-region cluster.

You can restore cluster data to the current cluster or another cluster in the same organization. You can also restore a database or table from the Backups tab.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Restoring to a cluster will completely erase all data in the destination cluster. All cluster data will be replaced with the data from the backup. The destination cluster will be unavailable while this operation is in progress. This operation cannot be canceled, paused, or reversed.
{{site.data.alerts.end}} 

You can [manage your own backups]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-customer-owned-backups.md %}), including incremental, database, and table level backups. To perform manual backups, you must configure either a userfile location or a cloud storage location.

## Patches and upgrades

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} supports the latest major version of CockroachDB and the version immediately preceding it. Support for these versions includes patch version updates and security patches.

### Major version upgrades

Major version upgrades are automatic for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters and opt-in for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. [Cluster Operators]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-operator) must initiate major version upgrades for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. When a major version upgrade is initiated for a cluster, it will upgrade to the latest patch version as well. 

Since upgrading a cluster can have a significant impact on your workload, make sure you review the release notes for the latest version for backward compatibility, cluster setting changes, deprecations, and known limitations. Cockroach Labs recommends initiating the upgrade during off-peak periods and monitor cluster and application health post-upgrade. If you notice functional or performance regression, you will have 72 hours to roll back the changes before the upgrade is automatically finalized. Note that some new features might be unavailable until the upgrade is finalized. For more information, see [Major version upgrades]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#major-version-upgrades).

### Patch upgrades

Although patch upgrades are applied automatically, you can configure the upgrade window and defer patch upgrades for 60 days. For more information, see [Patch version upgrades]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#patch-version-upgrades).
