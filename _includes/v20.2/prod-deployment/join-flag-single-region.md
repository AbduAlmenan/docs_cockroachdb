When starting a cluster in a single region, set 3-5 `--join` addresses. Each starting node will attempt to contact one of the join hosts, which distribute all node addresses to the cluster. In case a join host can't be reached, the node will try another address on the list until it can join the gossip network. We do not recommend listing more than 5 `--join` addresses, because this increases the time for a new cluster to reach stability.
