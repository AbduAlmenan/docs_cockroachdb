{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
It is best practice for {{ site.data.products.db }} Console users to login with Single Sign-On (SSO), with two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled for the SSO provider. This prevents potential attackers from using stolen credentials to accesss or tamper with your critical data.
{{ site.data.products.db }} currently supports SSO with GitHub, and will be adding more SSO providers in the near future.
Visit your CockroachDB Cloud Console's [account settings page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/account/profile) and switch to SSO to improve the security of your cluster.
