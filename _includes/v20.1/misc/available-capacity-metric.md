If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes running on a single machine (this is [not recommended in production](recommended-production-settings.html#topology)), you must explicitly [set the store size](start-a-node.html#store) per node in order to display this graph correctly. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the value of the maximum capacity.
