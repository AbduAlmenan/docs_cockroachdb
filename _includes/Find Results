   22  - Previously, clicking **cancel** while editing a cluster would take users back to the **Clusters** page. Now, users are taken back to the cluster's **Overview** page.

   46: Because your cluster will be unavailable while its single node is stopped and restarted with v20.1, prepare your application for this brief downtime, typically a few minutes. Also during this time, the [**SQL Users**](user-authorization.html#create-a-sql-user) and [**Tools**](tools-page.html) pages in the {{ site.data.products.db }} Console will be disabled.

   82  - [`GRANT`](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/grant.html) and [`REVOKE`](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/revoke.html) statements will be blocked and return an error. This is because privileges are stored with table metadata and, therefore, privilege changes are considered schema changes, from an internal perspective. Update your application or tooling to prevent privilege changes during this period. Once the upgrade has been finalized, changes to user privileges can resume.
   83  
   84:    - This limitation also means that you will not be able to add or delete SQL users, or change existing users' passwords, on the [**SQL Users**](user-authorization.html#create-a-sql-user) tab of the {{ site.data.products.db }} Console until the upgrade has been finalized. Attempting to do so will result in an error.
