Only [Console Admins](managed-console-access-management.html#console-admin) can create SQL users. If you are a [Developer](managed-console-access-management.html#developer), you need to ask your Console Admin for the credentials of a SQL user to access the database. You can find out who's your Console Admin by [signing in to the Console](managed-sign-up-for-a-cluster.html#sign-in) and navigating to **Cluster Overview** > **Access**.
