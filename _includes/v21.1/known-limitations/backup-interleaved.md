Interleaving data is now disabled by default in v21.1. Your backup will fail if your cluster includes interleaved data. To include interleaved data, use the [`INCLUDE_DEPRECATED_INTERLEAVES` option](backup.html#include-deprecated-interleaves). Note that, interleaving will be permanently removed from CockroachDB in a future release, so you will be unable to `RESTORE` backups containing interleaved tables to any future versions.
