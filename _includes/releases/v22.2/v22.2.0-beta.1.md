<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Redacted logs will now reveal pretty-printed keys, except for the index key values themselves. For example `/Table/42/1222/‹x›` will be shown instead of `‹x›` (which was shown previously). This improved redaction is available for the `/Table` keyspace for both system and application tenants. Other keyspaces such as `/Meta1`, `/Meta2`, `/Local`, etc. are not yet supported.  Release justification: low risk, high benefit observability changes [#87647][#87647]
- The following types of data are now considered "safe" for reporting from within debug.zip: - Range start/end keys, which can include data from any indexed   SQL column. - Key spans, which can include data from any indexed SQL column. - Usernames and role names. - SQL object names (including DB, schema, table, sequence, view,   type, and UDF names)  Release justification: high value observability changes necessary to meet our upcoming compliance mandates. [#88266][#88266]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- For pgwire-level prepare statements, support the case where the number of the type hints is greater than the number of placeholders in the given query. [#88146][#88146]
- Information_schema.role_routine_grants is now populated properly with both builtin functions and user-defined functions. Release justification: low risk GA blocker. [#88233][#88233]
- The PostgreSQL compatibility function `obj_description` now supports retrieving comments on schemas. [#88263][#88263]
- The index of a placeholder is now replaced to always be `$1` to limit fingerprint creations. [#88365][#88365]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- `debug zip`'s `--redact-logs` flag has been deprecated in favor of the `--redact` flag, which applies to a broader scope than just logs (but also includes logs). The new `--redact` flag will trigger the redaction of all sensitive data in debug zip bundles, except for range keys, which have been deemed necessary to keep unredacted as they are essential to support CockroachDB. The `--redact-logs` flag will still remain, but users of debug zip will be warned of its deprecation if they use it, and it will be interpreted as `--redact` instead.  Release justification: low risk, high value change necessary for upcoming compliance mandates [#88266][#88266]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- On the SQL Activity Session Details page the Most Recent Statement show the last active query instead of No Active Statement. [#88057][#88057]
- Update filter labels from "App" to "Application Name" and from "Username" to "User Name" on SQL Activity pages. [#88144][#88144]
- Transaction execution id column now exists in the blocked statements table in the active stmt details page [#88135][#88135]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- This patch fixes incorrect results from queries which utilize locality-optimized search on the inverted index of a table with REGIONAL BY ROW partitioning. [#88114][#88114]
- The function `pg_catalog.pg_get_viewdef` now works properly for materialized views. [#88143][#88143]
- Cluster and tenant restores of dropped or adding tenants would incorrectly activate those tenants during restore. [#88157][#88157]
- The `current_setting` builtin function now properly does not result in an error when checking a custom session setting that does not exist and the `missing_ok` argument is true. [#88158][#88158]
- `CREATE TABLE foo as (SELECT * FROM crdb_internal.check_consistency(...))` no longer panics the gateway node. [#88227][#88227]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly not fetch rows with NULL values when reading from the unique secondary index when multiple column families are defined for the table and the index doesn't store some of the NOT NULL columns. [#88210][#88210]
- Fixed crashes in changefeed code when running on recent go versions. [#88231][#88231]
- For statement execution insights, the value for the end time was updated to be congruent with the start time and latency. [#88276][#88276]
- Completed stmt diagnostics bundles now persist in the UI in stmt diag bundle pages [#88286][#88286]
- Dropping temporary tables and sequences should check privilege too. [#88305][#88305]
- The pgwire DESCRIBE step no longer fails with an error while attempting to look up cursors declared with names containing special characters. [#88316][#88316]
- Jobs pages refreshes data at an interval of 10s [#88285][#88285]
- Fixed a crash in changefeed expressions when JSON encoding an empty projection. [#88311][#88311]
- CockroachDB now more promptly reacts to query cancellations (e.g. due to statement timeout being exceeded) after the query spilled to disk. [#88378][#88378]
