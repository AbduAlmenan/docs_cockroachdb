The **Clusters** page of the Console provides a high-level view of your clusters. For each cluster, the following details display:

- The cluster's **Name**
- The **Version** of CockroachDB the cluster is running
- The **Regions** the cluster is in
- The date and time the cluster was **Created**

[ADD SCREENSHOT - waiting for Version column to be removed]

To view and manage a specific cluster, click the name of the cluster. The [**Overview**](managed-cluster-overview.html) page will display.
