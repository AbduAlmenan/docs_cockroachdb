### DB Console changes

- Manually enqueueing a range in the GC queue now properly respects the SkipShouldQueue option. This can be useful to force the GC of a specific Range. [#60746][#60746]

### Bug fixes

- Previously if `RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` was followed by `ROLLBACK`, the `sql.txn.rollback.count` metric would be incremented. This was incorrect, since the txn had already committed. Now that metric is not incremented in this case. [#60251][#60251]
- Fixed bug that could report that a protected timestamp limit was exceeded when the limit was disabled, if an error were to occur while protecting a record. [#60961][#60961]
- Fix a bug whereby high-latency global clusters could sometimes fall behind checkpointing resolved timestamps. [#60926][#60926]
- Creating interleaved partitioned indexes is now disallowed. Previously, the database would crash when trying to create one. [#61423][#61423]
