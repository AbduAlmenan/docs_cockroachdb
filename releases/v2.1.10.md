### Bug fixes

- Fixed a rare data corruption bug in RocksDB caused by newer Linux kernel's handling of i_generation on certain file systems. [#41394][#41394]
- Fixed a bug causing the `cluster_logical_timestamp()` function to sometimes return incorrect results. [#41442][#41442]
- Fixed bug causing rapid network disconnections to lead to cluster unavailability because goroutines waited for a connection which would never be initialized to send its first heartbeat. [#42166][#42166]
- Fixed a case where we incorrectly determine that a query (or part of a query) which contains an `IS NULL` constraint on a unique index column returns at most one row, possibly ignoring a `LIMIT 1` clause. [#42793][#42793]
- [`ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS`](../v2.1/alter-index.html) no longer fails when using an unqualified index name that does not match any existing index. Now it is a no-op. [#42841][#42841]
- The `CommandQueue` no longer holds on to buffers if they become too large. This prevents unbounded growth of memory that may never be reclaimed. [#42961][#42961]
- The `CommandQueue` now clears references to objects in its buffers to allow those objects to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. [#42961][#42961]
- Server now properly authenticates admin RPC requests. [#42910][#42910]
- Fixed a bug causing disk stalls to allow a node to continue heartbeating its liveness record and prevent other nodes from taking over its leases, despite being completely unresponsive. [#41734][#41734]
