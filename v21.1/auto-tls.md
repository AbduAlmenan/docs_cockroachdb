title: Use Auto TLS to generate security certificates
summary: Let CockroachDB handle TLS cert creation for encrypted inter-node and client-node communication.
toc: true
---

To secure your CockroachDB cluster's inter-node and client-node communication, you need to provide a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that has been used to sign keys and certificates (SSLs) for:

- Nodes
- Clients
- the DB Console (optional)

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
This feature is an alpha release in CockroachDB v21.1 with core functionality that may not yet meet your requirements. Planned enhancements in future versions include:

- Auto TLS cert generation when adding nodes to an existing cluster.
- Support for cross-region deployments (cases where not all nodes are on the same subnet, and the listening and advertised addresses are different).
- Identification of misconfigurations leading to helpful error messages.
- Other CLI instructions and feedback.

With Auto TLS, your cluster creates the CA (certificate authority) required for secure communication with other nodes and clients and then distributes it among the nodes. The cluster also creates the certificates that nodes require to connect to other nodes.

To receive all certificates, each node must be started with the same secure token that you provide. This simplifies the default cluster creation process. Rather than requiring an operator to generate and distribute cert files, each node only requires this single token string that you will include as part of a one-time `cockroach connect` command.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
To create client certificates, you will still need to run [`cockroach cert create-client`](cockroach-cert?#create-the-certificate-and-key-pair-for-a-client) or the equivalent [OpenSSL commands](create-security-certificates-openssl#step-3-create-the-certificate-and-key-pair-for-the-first-user).

## Step 1: Configure nodes

1. On each node, ensure that the machine has a directory for the node to use to store cert files.

  `mkdir certs`

2. For each node, run `cockroach connect`, specifying the initial number of nodes and the address and ports that each will use.

  ```
  `cockroach connect --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --certs-dir=certs --num-expected-initial-nodes 3 --init-token=<secret> --join=localhost:26258,localhost:26259
  ```

3. Run `cockroach start` on each machine from within the directory where you want node data to be stored. This starts each node, but does not yet initialize the cluster.

  ```
  cockroach start --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --certs-dir=certs --join=localhost:26258,localhost:26259 --http-addr=localhost:8080
  ```

## Step 2: Create client certs

On any nodeâ€™s machine, create client keys to securely distribute for cluster administration.

```
cockroach cert create-client root --ca-key=certs/ca.key --certs-dir=certs
```

Note: After using the root user to create additional users, distribute certs for additional users using the principle of least privilege.

## Step 3: Initialize the cluster

Run `cockroach init --certs-dir=certs --host=localhost:26257`.
