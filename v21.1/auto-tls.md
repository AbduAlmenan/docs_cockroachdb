title: Use Auto TLS (alpha) to generate security certificates
summary: Let CockroachDB handle TLS cert creation for encrypted inter-node and client-node communication.
toc: true
---

To secure your CockroachDB cluster's inter-node and client-node communication, the cluster requires a certificate authority (CA) certificate that is used to sign keys and certificates (SSLs) for:

- Nodes
- Clients
- Optionally: the [DB Console](authentication.html#using-a-public-ca-certificate-to-access-the-db-console-for-a-secure-cluster) and Cluster API

With Auto TLS, your cluster creates the CA (certificate authority) certificate and key pair required for secure communication with other nodes and clients and then securely distributes these among the nodes. The cluster also creates the certificates that nodes require to connect to other nodes.

<span class="version-tag">New in v21.1:</span> This feature is an alpha release with core functionality that may not yet meet your requirements. Planned enhancements in future versions include:

- Auto TLS cert generation when adding nodes to an existing cluster, though cert generation for new nodes is already possible using [`cockroach cert`](cockroach-cert.html) on clusters that initially used Auto TLS. Note that relevant example steps in [Start a Local Cluster](secure-a-cluster.html) use a folder name for storing the CA key that may differ from what you have used with Auto TLS, so these may need to be adapted.
- Support for cross-region deployments (cases where not all nodes are on the same subnet, and the listening and advertised addresses are different).
- Identification of misconfigurations leading to helpful error messages, while suppressing unnecessary warnings.
- Other CLI instructions and feedback.

To receive the CA key and certificate, each node must be provided with the same token string before it is started. This simplifies the default method for [creating secure clusters](secure-a-cluster.html). Rather than manually generating and distributing the certificates and keys to all nodes, you run a one-time `cockroach connect` command for each node, specifiying the token. All other certificates that the node requires to communicate with other nodes and with clients are generated on each node and signed by the CA.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
To create client certificates, you will still need to run [`cockroach cert create-client`](cockroach-cert.html#create-the-certificate-and-key-pair-for-a-client) or the equivalent [OpenSSL commands](create-security-certificates-openssl.html#step-3-create-the-certificate-and-key-pair-for-the-first-user).

## Step 1: Configure nodes

The example commands below must be tailored for your environment and run for each node. In a production environment, this would typically require running the commands once on each machine for the single node that each one hosts. However, these examples depict multiple nodes running on a single machine, varying their ports rather than their hosts.

1. For each node, ensure that the machine has a directory for the node to use to store cert files.

    ~~~ shell
    cd node1
    mkdir certs
    ~~~

1. For each node, run `cockroach connect`, specifying the initial number of nodes. For the first node:

    ~~~ shell
    cockroach connect --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --certs-dir=certs --num-expected-initial-nodes 3 \
    --init-token=<secret>
    ~~~

This process will not terminate until the cluster and all its nodes have initialized.

3. Run `cockroach start` for each node from within the directory where you want node data to be stored. This starts the node, but does not yet initialize the cluster.

  ~~~ shell
  cockroach start --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --certs-dir=certs \
  --join=localhost:26258,localhost:26259 --http-addr=localhost:8080
  ~~~

## Step 2: Create client certs

On any nodeâ€™s machine, create client keys to securely distribute for cluster administration.

~~~ shell
cockroach cert create-client root --ca-key=certs/ca.key --certs-dir=certs
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
After using the root user to create additional users, distribute certs for additional users using the principle of least privilege.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 3: Initialize the cluster

~~~ shell
cockroach init --certs-dir=certs --host=localhost:26257`
~~~
