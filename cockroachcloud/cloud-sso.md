title: Single Sign-On (SSO) for CockroachDB Cloud
summary: Learn about SSO Authentication for the Cockroach Cloud Console

Users may authenticate to the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud) using Single Sign-On (SSO). GitHub, Google, and Microsoft are currently supported as identity providers (IdPs).

[Enterprise authentication features](#private-preview-enterprise-authentication) are currently available in Private Preview. File a [support ticket](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/) to enquire about the Enterprise Authentication for Cloud SSO Private Preview.

Authentication with a centralized identity managed by a dedicated IdP offers several security advantages:

- All supported SSO providers (Google, Microsoft, and GitHub) support multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Administrators avoid responsibility for managing an additional set of credentials and tying those to other identities and credentials. Every additional credential or identity management operation introduces risk as well as costing effort, so minimizing these is doubly advantageous.
- Administrators can onboard and offboard users quickly and efficiently.

## Private Preview: Enterprise authentication

### Support for SAML and OIDC identity protocols

[Security Access Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/) are identity protocols that allow applications to rely on IdPs for authentication.

With support for SAML and OIDC, {{ site.data.products.db }} allows enterprise organizations to use a wide variety of self-hosted or SaaS enterprise IdP solutions, such as Okta, Active Directory, Onelogin.

### Extended configuration options

Enterprise authentication allows {{ site.data.products.db }} organization admins to configure a list of allowed and disallowed authentication methods.

### Autoprovisioning

This feature allows organization admins to share an organization-specific sign-up/sign-in URL. This removes the need to invite users to your organization.

### How to enable Enhanced SSO for {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}

File a [support ticket](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/) to enquire about the Enhanced SSO Private Preview.

The following information will be required:

- Customer name
- CC Organization Id
- Do you need auto-provisioning? [Yes / No]
- Specific login methods to enable (any not mentioned here will be disabled)
- Identity provider to setup [Okta / Active Directory / Azure Active Directory / Onelogin / Other]

- If using SAML, provide **one of** the following options:
	- (Option 1): The customer IDP metadata XML file
	- (Option 2): All of the following:
		- Sign in URL
		- Signing certificate
- If using OIDC, provide all of the following:
	- Issuer URL (ends with .well-known/openid-configuration)
	- Client ID
	- Client Secret (If the customer prefers using a frontend channel, then this value wonâ€™t be needed)
		{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
		This value should be treated as moderately sensitive and so should be passed to the Identity team via OnePassword
		{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Initial response to the ticket will have a 2 business days SLA. After Enhanced SSO  is enabled, the support team will reach out to again to finalize and confirm the setup.

## {{ site.data.products.db }} SSO Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will it work if I try to sign in with SSO without explicitly setting it up for my account, if I already use an email from an SSO Provider (e.g., my-example-account@gmail.com)?

No, that won't work until you set up SSO for your account with that specific identity provider. Using an email associated with an SSO provider (Google, GitHub, or Microsoft) does not automatically enable SSO.

To change your SSO method to use that provider, visit **My Account** in the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud).

### Once I change my active login method to a new SSO provider, can I still sign in using my email/password combination or my GitHub identity?

No. Only one authentication method can be active for each {{ site.data.products.db }} Console user at a time. Visit **My Account** in the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud) to configure which authentication method is active.

### Does this change how administrators invite users?

At the moment, no. The [workflow for inviting team members](console-access-management.html#invite-team-members-to-cockroachdb-cloud) to {{ site.data.products.db }} remains the same.

### As an admin, how do I deprovision a user's access to {{ site.data.products.db }} Console if they leave the relevant project?

If a user is using SSO, deleting the user's identity at the level of the SSO provider (e.g., deleting their Google account), will remove their access to the {{ site.data.products.db }} organization.

To remove a user's access to {{ site.data.products.db }} without deleting their SSO identity, you can [remove their {{ site.data.products.db }} user identity from your org](console-access-management.html#delete-a-team-member) in the console.

### Can admins require a particular login method for their {{ site.data.products.db }} organization?

Currently, no.
