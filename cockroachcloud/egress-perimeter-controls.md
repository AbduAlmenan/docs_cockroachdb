This page describes the reasons to use Egress Perimeter Controls for enhanced security in {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters, and gives an overview of the user-flows involved.

## Why use Egress Perimeter Cntrols

{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters must access external resources for many purposes:

- Managing backups as part of a disaster recovery plan
- Using [Change data capture (CDC) changefeeds](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/change-data-capture-overview.html)
- Exporting data
- Exporting logs

By default, clusters can access external resources via the internet without restriction. This potentially leaves a cluster open to a *data exfiltration* scenario, wherein an attacker, often a [malicious insider](https://www.cisa.gov/defining-insider-threats) steals data by sending backups, changefeeds, data, or logs to a source that they control. 

Operators of {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters can remove this risk by using Egress Perimiter Controls. This feature enables [admins](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role) to restrict egress to a specified external destinations. This adds a strong layer of protection against malicious data exfiltration. Along with other measures such as private clusters, ...!!!link and fill out, this is an important component in an overall strategy for maximizing network security.

<!-- hmm, how to message about the compliance advantage... down the road, can connect to PCI info and stuff, but is it premature? maybe some vaguer messaging-->
<!-- query!!! does this let you set specific types of data as allowed for different destinations? are there permissions you can delegate for different egress routes or what? the quote is a bit ambiguos but suggests that yeah you can; presumably this will be clear when you see the API...: -->
<!-- "So an admin could specify which cloud bucket(s) are allowed for backup/restore purposes, or which kafka cluster(s) are allowed for CDC purposes, and so on. And security/risk teams can also get a list of external resources accessible at a given point for their auditing / compliance purposes. This is another network security differentiator in the world of DBaaS. Only Cloud Spanner (and probably AlloyDB) allows for something of this nature using VPC Service Controls, but that is kludgy to setup & maintain and itâ€™s not cloud-agnostic."" -->

!!!contains raw source, disregard sloppy copy
Each egress rule builds upon any of the existing ones, and could be configured for a destination CIDR range or for a FQDN (Fully-qualified domain name) assigned to the external resource. Additionally, you could configure path based filtering to a resource by specifying particular endpoints off of its base URL. One thing to note is that in addition to the egress rules you manage, CockroachDB dedicated comes with some default rules to enable seamless cluster operations and help comply with the service SLA.

The Cloud API provides a real-time status for if the rule enablement is in progress or is complete.


## Using Egress Perimeter Controls with the Cloud Console API

### Prerequisites

You will need a Cockroach Cloud account with billing enabled, as Egress Perimeter Controls are only available for {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}, not {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters, and {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters cost money to run.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Be aware that {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters cost money to run. The steps described here cannot be performed without cost. (need better messaging, but i feel this is worth calling out... this isn't a tutorial you can follow along just for the learns without paying for it!!!)
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You will need an API key with permissions to `edit` clusters in your org. You can provision API keys in the cloud console: [Create API Keys](console-access-management.html#create-api-keys)

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The operations descrubed here require an API key with very powerful permissions, to modify dedicated clusters, including adding potentially malicious egress rules, which could allow the very attack that this feature is meant to prevent. Do not allow this key to be copied or transmitted in any form. This includes ensuring that nobody can see or photograph the screen of your computer. Delete the API key when the operations are completed.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

!!!{

note to self
the docs say "Service accounts are used by applications accessing the Cloud API to manage CockroachDB Cloud clusters within the organization. Service accounts are not for human users."
But it seems like API keys can only be issued to service accounts, so if a human needs to use the API (before SSO is available, which it will be soon but isn't yet), they need to use service accounts. these docs point you in that direction: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html

}

### Step 1. Create a new dedicated cluster with Egress Perimeter Controls enabled


1. [Create a new {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster](create-your-cluster.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
This is a new feature as of 22.2.0, so create a new cluster of at least that version.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Find your cluster's universally unique identifier (UUID). To do this, click on the name of your cluster from the [clusters page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters) in the console. The UUID will appear in the URL of the overview page for that specific cluster, in the format:

`https://cockroachlabs.cloud/cluster/{ your cluster's UUID }/overview`


### Step 2. Initialize the shell with your API key and cluster id

1. Save your API key and cluster UUID as environment variables.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
CC_API_KEY={ your API key }
CLUSTER_ID={ your cluster UUID }
~~~

1. Inspect your cluster.



{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://management-staging.crdb.io/api/v1/clusters/{ your cluster ID }' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer { your API key }"
~~~

~~~json
{

  "updated_at": "2022-09-28T18:25:03.178651Z",
  "deleted_at": null
}%
~~~


### Step 3. Use the API to change your cluster's egress behavior to deny-by-default

POST /api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/networking/egress-traffic-policy
- enable/disable egress rule management


### Step 3. Customize your allowed destinations 

### Check current egress rules/allowed destinations



[API spec]

`GET /api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/networking/egress-rules`

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/networking/egress-traffic-policy' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CC_API_KEY"
~~~

~~~txt

~~~


- return all egress rules associated with the given cluster

Check 


Create a maximally secure base state for your cluster by changing it's behavior to deny egress unless the destination has been specifically allowed.


"to convert it to DENY-ALL mode"

"When customer is ready to migrate data from another database or write fresh data to the cluster (especially if it is production), a user with Org Admin role invokes a new API [what endpoint and body?] to convert it to DENY-ALL mode such that no egress traffic is allowed to external resources. This is likely just a temporary thing to set the stage for next step.""

"The Org Admin then configures egress rules for the cluster to define the egress perimeter policy using another set of APIs (as documented in the RFC), based on what external resources may be required by the application team for their own managed backups, CDC, export/import etc.

If the customer enables CMEK, Log export to cloudwatch/cloud logging or Metrics export to Datadog, then we'll automatically add egress rules to relevant external resources in those cases, and the customer won't have to take a separate action."

## Appendix: Egress Rule Syntax

name: a descriptive partial identifier for an egress rule. The name, cluster id pair uniquely identify a rule. The name should also serve as documentation for the rule's purpose.

type: can be either CIDR or FQDN. This field is not strictly required as we can rely on regex matching on the host field to determine rule type. Serves to facilitate filtering on the front end and code structure in the backend.

crl_managed: a boolean value specifying if the egress rule is managed by CC operators or customers. Immutable after creation.

host: the destination that is allowed for outgoing connections. Can be either a CIDR range or a fully qualified domain name.

ports: the ports allowed for outgoing connections to a specific host.

paths: the URL paths allowed for outgoing connections to a specific host, port pair.

description: a longer description meant to detail the purpose of the egress rule.


Below is an example of a list of egress rules in json format (UUID fields are ignored).
