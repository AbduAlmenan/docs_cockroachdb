We have been busy building out and improving the CockroachCloud experience and are excited to invite you to a **closed beta** of a new version that will be permanently free to consume!

We have turned on the ability to create a CockroachCloud Free cluster in your account. Your existing clusters will be unaffected by this additional capability. You will now be able to create up to five free clusters in your organization.

## What is CockroachCloud Free?

CockroachCloud Free delivers free CockroachDB clusters for you and your organization. It is a managed instance of CockroachDB that also removes the friction of initial cluster sizing and auto-scales based on your application traffic. While we have eliminated the concept of nodes for you, there will be an upper limit of usage of up to 1 vCPU and 5GB storage per free cluster. More information to follow.

## Can CockroachCloud Free be used for production apps?

CockroachCloud Free is currently in beta and as such, it is not suitable for production use. Specifically, there are capabilities we are still working on enabling such as the ability to enable backups, and no-downtime upgrades to a paid tier. These capabilities and more are coming soon!

## Whatâ€™s next?

Free clusters require minimal configuration, and will be instantly available, so all that's left to do is build an app and point it to the free cluster. And while you're at it, we would love some feedback on your experience so we can improve it for all.
